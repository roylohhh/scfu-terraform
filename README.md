# Secure-Consent-Form-Upload-and-Mapping-System
The Secure Consent Form Upload and Mapping System is a solution to enhance the handling of paper-based consent forms within a digital consent framework for clinical genomics research. It allows participants to use paper forms while maintaining digital consent protocols and ensures the security and integrity of genomic data.

##Main Objectives:
1. Secure Management of Consent Forms: Ensure that participantâ€™s paper and digital consent forms are securely handled and stored.
2. Seamless Integration: Facilitate the smooth transition between paper and digital consent processes, maintaining data integrity throughout.
3. Non-repudiation: Ensure non-repudiation of participant consent or the creation/modification of participant data.
4. Enhanced Data Confidentiality/Integrity: Protect data and verify the authenticity of consent forms, preventing tampering and ensuring accurate record-keeping.
5. Scalable Architecture: Develop a flexible system architecture that supports future enhancements and evolving consent management need
